instanceof 
-  keyword in java 
-  used for testing run time type information.(RTTI)
- binary operator

It  checks whether a reference variable is pointing to an object of a particular type (class, subclass, or interface).

The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator(in run time)  because it compares the instance with type. It returns either true or false. 

It  allows you to check whether an object is an instance of a particular class, subclass, or interface.

Safe Casting: It's often used before down casting a reference  to a specific type to prevent ClassCastException errors.

Syntax:
objectRef instanceof ClassOrInterface

It returns - 

true: If the reference variable  pointing to an object , is an instance of the specified Class/Interface or any of its subclasses or implementations.

false: If the object is not an instance of the specified Class/Interface, or if the object is null.


- If a class extends another class, an object of the subclass is also considered an instance of the superclass.
-It can also check if an object implements a specific interface.
- Null Checks: instanceof returns false when the object being checked is null. 


Best Practices:
Use instanceof to ensure type safety before casting.




eg ---Object <----Emp <---Mgr <---SalesMgr
Object <---- Emp <--- Worker

What will be o/p ?
Emp e =new Mgr(...);
e instanceof Mgr - true
e instanceof Emp - true
e instanceof Object -true
e instanceof SalesMgr  -false
e instanceof Worker -false
e=null;
e instanceof Emp/Mgr/SalesMgr/Worker/Object  -false
