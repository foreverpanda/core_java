}
Are there any objects marked for GC ?

3. What will happen (solve ready code samples : along with mem pics )
day2-data\day2_help\params_passing
3.1 TestParamPassing1.java
3.2 TestParamPassing2.java

4. Hands on

Create a  class Point2D   for representing a point in x & y(int) co-ordinate system.
(Tight encapsulation please !)

4.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

4.2 Add  show() method  --to return point's x & y co-ords


4.3 
Add a non static  , isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.
Hint - Ask yourself - 
How will you invoke it from the tester ?
Hint 
In Tester

Point2D p1=new Pont2D(....);
Point2D p2=new Pont2D(....);
sop(p1 +" "+p2);
boolean status=p1.isEqual(p2);


In Point2D class
- x,y
constructor
//method declaration - isEqual
//this=p1 , anotherPoint=p2
boolean isEqual(Point2D anotherPoint)
{
 sop(this);
 sop(anotherPoint);
 return (this.x==anotherPoint.x) && (this.y==anotherPoint.y);
}

4.4 
Add a non static method , calculateDistance , to calc distance between 2 points
Hint : use distance formula.

Hint - Ask yourself - 
How will you invoke it from the tester ?


4.5  Create a separate Driver(main)  class(for UI )  , "TestPoint" , with main(..)

4.6  Accept x,y co-ordinates for 2 points & store the co-ordinates
4.7  Display x,y co-ordinates of both of the points plotted  (using show() method)

4.8  (OPTIONAL WORK)
Find out if the points  are same or different (Hint : isEqual)

Print the message accordingly. (print SAME or DIFFERENT)
If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.


Day 3
1. Complete Pending work.

2. Refer to today's sequence  & notes (pdf) 
-  to revise access specifiers , packages ,  classpath , arrays

Re factor (modify) & add Point2D class under the package - com.developers.geometry
Add TestPoint class under the package - com.tester

3.2 Make necessary changes , to remove compilation errors.
(How to compile ?
Compile from src
javac -d ..\bin com\tester\TestPoint.java
)

3.3 To run the class ,
cd ..\bin
How will you run it ?
java com.tester.TestPoint

2.1 Complete pending tasks (complete optinal tasks of Day 3 first)

3. Optional assignment for  Inheritance, Polymorphism, Casting (Bank Account System)
By the end of this assignment, you will be able to
- Apply inheritance to model real-world entities.
- Use method overriding and polymorphism.
- Perform upcasting , downcasting .

Problem Statement

A bank(eg HDFC)  offers support for creating  different types of accounts to its customers:

Saving Account  -> applicable for earning interest.

Current Account ->  allows overdraft facility.

Bank Account (common parent) -> defines general features of all accounts.

You are required to build a simple banking system using Java OOP concepts.

Assignments
Q1. Basic Inheritance

Create a class BankAccount with:

Fields: accountNumber (int), balance (double) , customer name (String) , phone number (String)

Add suitable constructor

Methods:

deposit(double amount)

withdraw(double amount) (should not allow negative balance by default)

getAccountSummary() - returns complete details of the account , in string format

getBalance() - returns account balance.

Create subclasses:

SavingAccount -> add interestRate field and method applyInterest().

CurrentAccount ->  add overdraftLimit field and method useOverdraftFacility().

SavingAccount -> should not allow any negative balance in  withdraw operation .It should fail in such case.

CurrentAccount -> should  allow any negative balance, in withdraw operation .It should not fail till it exceeds the overdraft limit. After overdraft limit is exceeded then withdraw operation should fail.


Task: Write a TestBanking class , with main() that creates one saving and one current account, performs deposits and withdrawals, and prints account summary.
You can hard code the values (no need to add Scanner today !)



Day 5

1. import day5.1 in your workspace
1.1 Open EventOrganizerApp.java
 - Trace the flow , line by line , to revise array of references , inheritance , upcasting , downcasting & instanceof checking


1.2 IMPORTANT
If you are still not comfortable with building new logic , you can solve Event Organizer assignment , on your own from scratch.

- Problem statement
 - Create Menu based Java application  , to organize an event  for  Students , Faculties (later can add Guest Speaker , Center Head , Alumni etc....)

Initially solve 1-4 options.

1. Prompt user for the event capacity.
2 Create suitable data structure to hold the participant details
3 Options
1. Register Student -

2. Register Faculty -
i/p : faculty details

3. Display all participant details (use  for-each)

4. Display specific participant details
i/p : seat no

5. Student Evaluation By Faculty
i/p : faculty seat no , student name , student grade (A+ , A , B+ , B , C+ , C)

6. Feedback submission By student
i/p : student seat no , faculty name, feedback comment

0. Exit
