Objective 1 :  Create a java appln to display welcome message on the console.

Steps 
How to compile ?
OPen cmd prompt : in <src>
javac -d ..\bin HelloWorld.java
It produces .class file/s under <bin>

How to run   java program(application)?
 cd ..\bin
java HelloWorld userName
Produces greeting message.



Objective 2 :  Write Java application , to say hello to user. User name will be supplied as command line argument.

(eg : java SayHello Madhura
O/P Hello , Madhura !)

3. JDK , JRE & JVM (refer to diagram - JDK vs JRE vs JVM)

4. Naming conventions in Java 
1. For the class  names-  1st letter of 1st word must start with upper case & then follow camel case notation.
eg : HelloWorld
2. For data members or methods(functions) -  1st letter of 1st word must start with lower case  & then follow camel case notation
eg : performanceIndex
calculateSalary()

3. constants -- all uppercase.
eg : PI

5. Rules on Identifiers

1. Identifiers must start with a letter, a currency character ($), or a connecting character such as the underscore ( _ ),  cannot start with a number!
2. Can't use a Java keyword as an identifier. 
3. They are Case sensitive 


6. Legal Access specifiers for data members n methods
private : visible within the same class
default(package private) --no access modifier ---visible within same package
protected : accessible withing the same package & accessible to sub classess via inheritance
public : accessible from anywhere.



7. Legal class level access specifiers - 
1. default(scope=current package only)
2. public (scope=accessible form any where)



Objective 3 : Accept 2 numbers as cmd line args , add them & display the result.



Explore Java API documentation (java docs)
java.lang  is the default package  name.
In java.lang package , Integer is a built in class 
It's method -

To parse (convert) the string -> int , use 
java.lang.Integer class's static method

public static int parseInt(String s) throws NumberFormatException
Input (i/p) - String
Output (o/p) - int 
It will raise run time error , in case of un parseable integers.

Hint 
Refer to java docs for any explanation of classes/methods..

8. Introduce Scanner class from java.util package

Steps for attaching scanner , to accept inputs from User.(UI)
 
What is Scanner ?
A class (java.util.Scanner)  that represents text based parser(It has inherent small ~ 1K buffer)
It can parse text data from any source --Console input,Text file , socket, string

Steps for using Scanner

1. import java.util.*; or import java.util.Scanner;
2. Create instance of Scanner class(object)  using Scanner class constructor
public  Scanner (InputStream in)
System.in --- standard input (stdin)
usage -- Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

3. Some methods of the Scanner class , to check data type 
public boolean hasNextInt(),
public boolean hasNextByte(),
public boolean hasNextLong()

4. To actually read n parse data
public int nextInt() throws InputMismatchException
public double nextDouble() throws InputMismatchException
public String next() throws InputMismatchException

public boolean nextBoolean() throws InputMismatchException
public String nextLine() throws InputMismatchException

5. Before terminating application close scanner.
public void close();


Objective 4 : Accept 2 double values as user input ,divide them & display the result.
data type : double

Objective 5 : Accept 2 int values as user input n compare them
If num1 < num2 , display mesg (1st no is < 2nd no)
If num1 > num2 , display mesg (1st no is > 2nd no)
If num1 == num2 , display mesg (1st no is same as 2nd no)

Objective 6 : Accept begin n end value from user(using scanner)
Print all odd numbers in the range.

Objective 7 : (while , switch-case)
Write java application , to accept month no from user , using Scanner
(Range 1-12 => Jan -Dec)
Display the name of a season accordingly
11,12,1,2 : Winter
3,4,5,6 : Summer
7,8,9,10 : Monsoon
The program should exit , with error message , if user enters the invalid month no)

Objective 9: Write java application to accept int(emp id) , double(salary) , emp's first name(string) , is permanent :  boolean from Scanner & display the same using printf

9. Basic rules 
1. Java compiler doesn't allow accessing of un initialized data members.
Test it !

2. A java source file can have more than one non public class(default)
NOTE : All access specifiers in java : private , default(no modifier) , protected , public
Legal Access specifiers for classes : default(no modifier) OR public

3. Files with no public classes(default scoped) can have a name that does not match with any of the classes in the file .
Test it !
 
4. There can be only one public class per source code file.

5. If there is a public class in a file, the name of the file must match the name
of the public class. 
For example, a class declared as public class Example {....}
must be in a source code file named Example.java.

10. Java Data Types 
refer to diagram from the slide

1. primitive data types 
boolean,char,byte,short,long,float,double

eg : 25
Hex : 0x19
Binary representation : 0001 1001

eg : -25 
2's complement = 1's complement + 1

1110 0110  1's complement
              1
-------------
1110 0111

Byte range : -2^7 --- 2^7-1 (-128  127)


2. reference types
class type , array type , interface type

Pointers vs java references
 Pointer arithmetic is not allowed in java.
reference --- holds internal representation of address (equivalent to object pointer in c++)

Conversions regarding primitive types

Automatic conversions(widening ) ---Automatic promotions
byte--->short--->int---> long--->float--->double
char ---> int

long --->float ---is considered automatic type of conversion(since float data type can hold larger range of values than long data type)


Rules ---
src & destination - must be compatible, typically dest data type must be able to store larger magnitude of values than  that of src data type.

1. Any arithmetic operation involving byte or short  :  automatically promoted to int

2. int & long ---> long
3. long & float ---> float
4. byte,short......& float & double----> double

Narrowing conversion --- forced conversion(type-casting) --applied by programmer
eg --- 
double ---> int 
float --> long
double ---> float 
....
